# Oxygen OS Debloater
This is a debloater for oxygen os. Though it doesn't come with many bloats there are few bloats that could be removed to increase performance and battery life.

###### Though the performance was almost the same to me battery life increased by, 30 - 80%. As before this, I was getting approximately 4 hours 30 min s.o.t and Now I am getting about 7 hours 30 min s.o.t.
